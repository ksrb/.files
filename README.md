#Dotfiles#

##Description##
Various dotfiles used across Linux, Mac, and Windows

Heavily based off of [bodhi5/.dotfiles](https://github.com/bodhi5/.dotfiles)

##Usage##
A linker script is provided to create symlinks between the dotfiles and the users
home directory

###Warning###
The script will first remove conflicting symlinks and add its own

##TODO##
* Shared basis for dotfiles (currently all files are either mac or windows specific)
* Linker script not implemented from windows dotfiles
* No Linux dotfiles
